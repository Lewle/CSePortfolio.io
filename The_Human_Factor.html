							<h2> The Human Factor </h2><br>
						</header>	
							
						<p>
						The ever-changing landscape of the Cyberworld has put human behaviour at the centre of Cyber Security, causing harm to confidentiality and integrity of availability <b>(CIA)</b> (CERT, 2013). 
						</p>
						Disagreeing with statements by Sasse & Rashid (2019), humans as the <b>‘weakest link’</b> to Cyber Security; what is crucial is to understand the functioning of humans as elements of socio-technical security systems through a people-centred perspective.
						<p>
						Consequently, examining effective strategies in human factor management and evaluating social and ethical considerations in the development and applicability of usable security is critical for fitting Cyber Security into work processes rather than disrupting them.

						<b style="color:black;">Key highlights of my learnings:</b>
						<p>
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Organisations need to embrace Information Risk Management in IT Project Management: </b>A risk assessment plays a vital role in ensuring a project’s success by identifying proactive measurements for handling unexpected events, while understanding the risk apatite of the organisation.
						</p>
						<p>
							However, based on my work experiences, there are circumstances, where there has not been enough effort been exerted for developing risk management in ERP project. Reasons could be either due to additional cost of carrying a risk assessment or due to a poor understanding of the importance of risk assessment in IT project management.
						</p>
						<p>
							For example, in my previous organisation (one of world’s leading textile manufactures), the ERP project implementation has taken 4 years, and still struggling for a successful completion, costing both financial and human resources.
						</p>
							<p>
							Previously, it was difficult for me to understand what went wrong. Now, based on my learning, I can understand that a risk assessment was not undertaken to assess the selection of ERP solution or supplier credibility or the entire ERP project management. It was evident that many aspects of the ERP projects were decided based purely on the cost factor and consequent of such actions have a significant adverse impact.
						</p>
							<p>
							A recent research based on the review of literature on ERP for SMEs published between 2000 and 2020, underline similar learning regards to the cost factor. The research concluded that ERP selection factors for the developed and developing countries are different, as total cost factor is vital for SMEs in developing countries compared to developed countries. Generally, ability of the ERP to align with business processes and procedure; compliance security, flexibility are considered when choosing an ERP (Yulianto et al., 2020). 
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Cyber security frameworks are more than checklists: </b>I realised the importance to learn similarities and differences of various Cybersecurity Frameworks, and how they can be used together to improve information protection. While learning the standards I realised that the best way to remember them or to understand them is to apply them in various risk assessment scenarios. Therefore, our group project on assessing risk on Acme’s ERP selection was particularly helpful in terms of realising the role and context of Information Risk Management in SDLC, and critically analysing IT systems in relation to organisational operating environment.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Learning through others: </b> Collaborative discussions have been an important platform to distinguish between writing styles in relation to the expression of opinions and understanding of various subject matters. This was particularly interesting learning when we (students) were answering to the same question in various viewpoints and writing styles.
						</p>
						<p>
							The group project has created a space for us to adopt real-life perspectives on teams in a virtual professional environment. Principles of socialisation, collaboration, and innovation emerged as key drivers of what I was looking for and depend on in a workplace. Respecting others’ opinion and building constructive arguments have been a key learning.
						</p>
						<p>
							Regards to report writing, it was an interesting factor to note that it is impossible to write assumptions in a proposal without referring to most source materials or clear understanding of the structure of the final report.

						<h3>Part 1: A Status Report Document for an Information Risk Management (IRM)</h3>
						</p>
						<p>
							Acme manufacturing is an SME (Small/Medium Enterprise) employing 150 staff. It produces sporks for niche industries and due to increased demand, has decided to purchase an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system to allow itself to more flexibly manage its supply chain. With this, the company should be able to scale production up or down to better meet demand.The company has shortlisted its selection down to 3 options:
						</p>
						<ul style="list-style-position: none;">

						<p><i>
							
							<li>A COTS (Commercial Off The Shelf) solution provided by a major manufacturer at a total cost (purchase plus support) of $100k per annum.</li>

							<li>An Open Source solution that will be installed and supported by their internal IT department, relying on community support for any escalations.</li>

							<li>An in-house created solution built by a student as part of her final year project and supported by the developer, as well as the internal IT department.</li>
						</p>
						</ul>

						<p>
							Currently, all the resource planning and scheduling are done via spreadsheets and that solution is becoming unwieldy. Your team has been retained as IT Risk Consultants with a brief to:
						</i></p>

						<p>
							Create a comprehensive risk assessment and report, recommending which solution the company should select. You are expected to justify your selection with supporting evidence, based on a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis.Create a Disaster Recovery solution for whichever option you recommend. They require a Recovery Point Objective of 15 minutes and a Recovery Time Objective of 4 hours. Your project status report should detail the possible information risk management related problems you have identified. Your Report should outline business challenges, the existing model and then highlight (briefly) what information risk management theories and practices you intend to utilise on this project. Build up rationale where appropriate, supported by literature.
						</p>

						<p>
						<b>Deliverables for the assignment:</b> Business scenario overview, including requirements obtained and assumptions made. Business challenges and rationale. Discussion and selection of methods/tools/approaches. Timeline of the completion of task.

						<h3>Tutor Feedback Comments:</h3>	 
						</p>
						<p>
							A good report which would have been made better with an exec summary that presented and summarised your conclusions. Your recommendations were not easy to find - but were good when I found them. Good use of charts and methodology but watch your word count and how you copy data - quotes from other sources MUST ALWAYS be presented as such - or you run the risk of plagiarism.
						</P>
						<ul style="list-style-position: none;">
										
						
							<li>A good demonstration of your existing expertise plus learning from the module in both your assessments and posts - good work.</li>

							<li>Good use of sources but think about using sources that argue against your viewpoint to add contrast.</li>

							<li>Well presented reports and posts - I particularly liked the charts and diagrams - always make things clearer and easier to understand.</li>

							How can we describe and represent the results of risk assessments in a way that is useful to decision makers, which clearly presents the assumptions made and their justification with respect to the knowledge upon which the assessment is based?

						<p>
						<b> Importance of Effective Risk Communication: </b> The risk assessments are next to hopeless without effective communication. The wiki article expands on the importance.
