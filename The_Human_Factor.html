							<h2> The Human Factor </h2><br>
						</header>	
							
						<p>
						The ever-changing landscape of the Cyberworld has put human behaviour at the centre of Cyber Security, causing harm to confidentiality and integrity of availability <b>(CIA)</b> (CERT, 2013). 
						</p>
						Disagreeing with statements by Sasse & Rashid (2019), humans as the <b>‘weakest link’</b> to Cyber Security; what is crucial is to understand the functioning of humans as elements of socio-technical security systems through a people-centred perspective.
						<p>
						Consequently, examining effective strategies in human factor management and evaluating social and ethical considerations in the development and applicability of usable security is critical for fitting Cyber Security into work processes rather than disrupting them.

						<p>
						</p>
						<p>
						 Queens Medical Centre is a community clinic and serves as the first point of call for any resident within the catchment area who happens to be unwell. The clinic has specialists in various areas of medicine. However, an appointment is required to schedule a consultation meeting with a specialist, which is done through a telephone call to the receptionist. The clinic has been experiencing high volume of calls, causing a lot of problems for residents to get access to care on time. Also, the management of Queens Medical Centre needs to plan to be able to respond to the rate of growth of the community population.
						</p>
						<p>
						To address this problem, the clinic management has decided to acquire a web-based appointment and scheduling management information system (ASMIS). This will allow appointments to be booked online by prospective patients. The system will collect vital information from the patient to be able to determine which specialist is best to attend to a given case, considering the availability and workload of the specialist doctor.
						</p>
						<p>
						The Management of the clinic is concerned about the recent high rate of cybercrime and the government’s policy on patient data protection. The IT team at the clinic has installed an ASMIS which is considered to be secure.
						</p>
						<p>
						However, Management is aware that investing in technological solutions is not enough and that human factors must be equally addressed to ensure optimal security. As the Cyber Security Officer on the team that manages the clinic’s IT systems, you are to advise the team on the human factors that need to be addressed for ASMIS to be usable and secure.
						</p>
							<p>
						</p>
						<b style="color:black;">Instructions </b>
						<ul style="list-style-position: none;">
						<p>
						</p>
						
							<li>Review the lecturecasts and journal articles provided in the reading list thus far (units 1-3).</li>

							<li>Identify three human factors and discuss each of them in your essay, considering Management’s requirements and expectations.</li>

						<h3>Tutor Feedback Comments:</h3>	 
						</p>
						<p>
						Thank you for submitting your individual essay for the Human Factor module
						</p>
						 <p>
						 In this essay, as the Cyber Security Officer on the team that manages the clinic’s IT systems, you are to advise the team on the human factors that need to be addressed for ASMIS to be usable and secure.
						 </p>
						 <p>
						 Overall, excellent work done. To improve your grades further, do take note of the developmental areas highlighted below.
						 </p>
						 <p><b style="color:black;">Knowledge and understanding</b></p>
						 <p>
						 You demonstrate excellent knowledge and understanding of the human factors, highlighting  operational, environmental,  psychosocial,  and compliance fatigue as some of the human factors. You provide a data from studies to support why it is an important issue, citing the Ponemon Institute ( 2020) survey.
						 </p>
						 <p><b style="color:black;">Criticality</b></p>
						 <p>
						 You demonstrate criticality in the discussion across all the issues you identified, drawing links to exposures identified and the potential risk as well as the resultant effect. For example, on operational and environmental factors, the links drawn between stress and how it impacts on cognition and the potential risk such as attention deficits and poor situational awareness were clever. It would have been excellent to situate it by showing a link to any of the security threats – ie information disclosure or usable security design.
						 </p>
						 <p><b style="color:black;">Use of relevant sources</b></p>
						 <p>
						 Relevant sources have been provided to support discussion which is excellent.
						 </p>
						 
						 <p><b style="color:black;">Structure and presentation</b></p>
						 <p>
						 The essay is well structured and well written which makes is easy to follow. The conclusion is also well written. It was an enjoyable read.  However, there were instances where solutions were being discussed instead, which was not the objective of the assignment. Also, there was an assumption that the reader knows about AMIS. A little information about ASMIS in the introduction would have been excellent.
						 </p>
						 <p><b style="color:black;"> Academic integrity</b></p>
						 <p>
						 References have been provided to support discusses which is excellent. Some referencing style could be better. An example is the reference for Greitzer, F. et al. (2014) which is not consistent with the recommended Harvard referencing style.

						<p>
						At the start of this unit, your tutor will assign two essays to each student, and you will need to provide review comments on both essays. Each review should demonstrate critical appreciation of the issues raised. To guide your responses, look at the guidelines for the peer review process on the Department’s homepage. Focus on the possible human factors that the management of ASMIS would have to deal with, as highlighted by your peers.
						</p>
						<p>
						You need to complete two 200 word reviews, one for each essay. Total word count for this assignment is 400 words.
						</p>
						<p>
						Title your reviews entries clearly using the following convention "Review 1" and "Review 2".

						</p>
						<p>
						Thank you for submitting your peer review report for the Human Factor module
						</p>
						 <p>
						 In this report you were invited to review two Individual essay submissions discussing the human factors that need to be addressed for ASMIS to be usable and secure.
						 </p>
						 <p>
						 Overall, excellent work done. To improve your grades further, do take note of the developmental areas highlighted below. 
						 </p>
						 <p><b style="color:black;">Knowledge and understanding </b></p>

						 You demonstrate excellent knowledge and understanding of the issues covered in both submissions. This is demonstrated through accurate interpretation of the issues discussed.
						 </p>
						 <p><b style="color:black;">Criticality </b></p>
						 <p>
						 You demonstrate excellent criticality by discussing problematic as well as positive areas found in the essays, which accurately reflect the submissions. For example, your point about student not addressing the issue in the assignment brief in submission 1638164836 was excellent. The positives identified and the feedback on 1638413162 were also excellent.
						 </p>
						 <p><b style="color:black;">Use of relevant sources </b></p>
						 <p>
						 It would have been excellent if you provided some suggestions and references to the author of submission 1638164836. The feedback would help the author to improve on the submission. For example you could mention three human factors and provide references as pointers for the author.
						 </p>
						 
						 <p><b style="color:black;">Structure and presentation </b></p>
						 <p>
						 Presentation of the reviews was excellent and well structured.  You identified the positives as well as the areas of improvement in the report with a clear summary in the end.
						 </p>
						 <p><b style="color:black;"> Academic integrity </b></p>
						 <p>

						<b style="color:black;"><h3>Assignment Guidance:</h3></b>
						<p>
						For this assignment, you are required to record a 10-minute presentation, along with a transcript of the audio file. The presentation slides should not be wordy or repeat verbatim the oral presentation. Visuals, illustration, statistics, charts, tables and indication of key pointers are welcome. In assessing the presentation for marking, emphasis will be place on the oral content. However, clarity of the visual presentation will also be taken into account.
						</p>
						<p>
						There is no word count for the slide presentation, and there is no fixed word count for the oral presentation/transcript. However, note that an average speech rate for a comfortable and clearly orally paced presentation is about 100-150 words per minute. Given that your presentation should be about 10 minutes, you can work against a minimum of 1,000 to a maximum of 1,500 words in your oral presentation/transcript.
						</p>
						<p>
						Before submitting the work, consider the following checklist:
						</p>
						<ul style="list-style-position: none;">
						<p>
						</p>
						
							<li>Are the major points identified?.</li>
							<li>Are the details presented clearly?</li>
							<li>Is the presentation well organised?</li>
							<li>Is the presentation clearly introduced and concluded?</li>
							<li>Is the presentation well-paced and timed?</li>
							<li>Is the information presented clearly and concisely?</li>
							<li>Is the presentation style lively, fluent and engaging?</li>

						<h3>Tutor Feedback Comments:</h3>	 
						</p>
						<p>
						Thank you for submitting your individual presentation for the Human Factor module
						</p>
						 <p>
						 In this task, as the Cyber Security Officer on the team that manages the clinic’s IT systems, you were invited to present solutions to address the issues you identified in the individual essay which advised the team on the human factors that need to be addressed for ASMIS to be usable and secure.
						 </p>
						 <p>
						 Overall, excellent work done. To improve your grades further, do take note of the developmental areas highlighted below. 
						 </p>
						 <p><b style="color:black;">Knowledge and understanding </b></p>
						 <p>
						 You demonstrate excellent knowledge and understanding of the human factors, highlighting some potential issues around lack of user ASMIS user readiness, psychosocial behaviours and cognitive bias in decision making. You identified measures such as carrying out periodic survey and investigations of business process and operational environment, security training and usable security design. While these are excellent measures which should be capable of addressing the issues identified, a brief discussion on how the intervention would be evaluated and measured to ensure continuous improvement would have been excellent. Adapting some framework would have helped to discuss this.
						 </p>
						 <p>
						 </p>
						 <p><b style="color:black;">Criticality </b></p>
						 <p>
						 You demonstrate some degree of criticality is discussing the measures and how these can be employed. For example, citing the Shappie et al (2019) to demonstrate the effectiveness of education in reducing the incidence of phishing attacks demonstrates criticality. The presentation considered only staff, but patients are also part of the users and therefore any solution proposed must also include patients.
						 </p>
						 <p><b style="color:black;">Use of relevant sources </b></p>
						 <p>
						 There is evidence of wider reading and consultation of relevant sources as shown in thorough the presentation which is excellent. Excellent use of sources and well referenced.
						 </p>
						 
						 <p><b style="color:black;">Structure and presentation </b></p>
						 <p>
						 Excellent structure and presentation. The use of visuals in the presentation improved the accessibility of the content. Providing some data from the Ponomon Institute study (2020) and the cost associated with unintended threat from IBM provided the context and engaged the audience
						 </p>
						 <p><b style="color:black;"> Presentation and Communication Skills </b></p>
						 <p>
						 Very good  presentation and communication skills. Very clear message and good use of visual aids to aid the communication of the content. You employed good communication techniques to carry the audience along.
