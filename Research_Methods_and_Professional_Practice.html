						<p><b style="color:#0E249E;">Literature Review, Research Methods, and Research Proposal</b>
						<p>
						In the beginning, as I had the anxiety about getting on with the module assessments and not falling behind, I tended to overlook the interpretation phase of what problems am I setting out to investigate and solve. I moved straight into the research mood based on the list of approved literature review topics. As I juggled between two research focuses, cyber security in transportation and waste management, I tended to read research sources and take notes without a clear idea of what was applicable beyond some very general opinion of the research subjects. After hours and days of work, exhausted and frustrated and without a clear understanding of where my research was heading, I ended up with a pile of unrelated and unusable notes and confusion about what I wished to clarify in my study.
						</p>
						<P>
						Nevertheless, just spending time interpreting am I trying to address the right research focus areas with the right research problem would have saved me this wasted time and given me an explicit view of the intent of conducting the research. Even more, it would have allowed me to build my opinions and insights involved at an early stage and be proficient at articulating problems and identifying which ones are crucial to research strategies.
						</p>
						<p>
						The focus on understanding the importance of research question formulation in Unit Two was crucial for the research process, setting boundaries for the research, such as 
						</P>
						<ul style="list-style-position: none;">
							<li>Establish the need for the research review; why does that matter?</li>

							<li>Contextualise the focus and aim of the review and who would be the audience?</li>

							<li>Contextualise the topic or issue problem set out to be solved; what other researchers have already tried? </li>
							<li>How is this research different from all other research? What are previously unknown or unfortunately neglected research limitations and gaps? Any plans to address any of those gaps and constraints? </li>
																	
							
						</ul>
						<p>
						The study focuses on  <b style="color:#0E249E;">Unit One</b>, which has helped understand the types of reasoning used in the scientific method as these are the key approaches for problem-solving, as stated in figure 1 and has helped to set the base for research methodology as,
						</P>
						<ul style="list-style-position: none;">
							<li>What perspective would be taken as a research approach? What framework is most suitable to use to synthesise the literature?</li>
						
						</ul>
						<p>
						The more precise nature of the deduction demands more of a sequential set of facts known to be confirmed through quantitative methods. In contrast, induction requires qualitative methods to create general observation followed by an idea that could explain what has been seen. 
						</p>
						<ul style="list-style-position: none;">
							<li>So, could both inductive and deductive processes need to be used to understand what is intended to be addressed as part of the chosen research? </li>
						
						</ul>

						<p><b>Figure 1: Common Approaches to Problem-solving from Various Angles (Source: Miessler, 2020)</b></p>
						
						<p>
						Though my main research focus was on Cyber Security in the Danish Transport System, after reviewing the literature, I narrowed the topic to the literature on implementing Cyber Security tools and/or techniques in local road and railway transportation systems. Based on the literature and research studies, it was evident that security considerations in road and railway and maritime have a distinctive background. I had a good feedback review regarding my Literature Review Outline, which gave me a positive sign that I am clearly on the right track. The literature review focused on evaluating the current state of technologies used in public transit and their vulnerabilities while highlighting the gap in the literature where existing reports in Denmark focused only on implementing cybersecurity policies and practices.  
						</p>
						<p>
						Obviously, it was essential to realise that you are not embarking on a piece of open-ended research. While I was writing the literature, I felt that I was answering a question that did not raise particular sharply focused issues. Hence, I ended up focusing on many technical and cybersecurity considerations, which ended up broadening the research area and introducing several research questions as highlighted in my Literature Review feedback. Though I had an excellent section of relevant resources and a clear and well-planned research thread all the way through the summative, I felt the focus area was too broad to handle. Therefore, I use a mind map as in Figure 2 to repeatedly brainstorm the primary research focus on Cyber Security tools and/or techniques in local transportation systems, with how and why questions. The use of a mind map helps create the base for Research Proposal Outline.
						</p>
						<p>
						Though mind mapping was a bit of a time-consuming task, it has helped me to use more of my own ideas and avoid wasting time roaming around research sources. As I learned to focus on it, I was able to make two important things clear to myself before I started my research and to dictate what’s relevant and what’s not as literature for the research.
						</p>

						<p><b>Figure 2: Mind Map </b></p>
						<p>
						For the  <b style="color:#0E249E;">Unit eight’s</b> Research Proposal Outline, as in Figure 3; when narrowing down the key research area, it was essential to pin down three things: the key components to address as elements of the research topic, how each component could be weighted, and the base for those weighting criteria.  Once the pivotal focus technological component was narrowed down, it was much easier to structure the motivation and objectives by referring only to particular literature materials addressing only that particular component and analysing the fundamental concepts used for that particular component.

						<p>
						A review of existing research and the module’s research design topics covered from <b style="color:#0E249E;">Unit three to Unit seven</b> supported laying down the basis for a critical review of different research methodologies.The critical review also paved the way for understanding the use of qualitative and quantitative data, considering the facts of what you are hoping to achieve and address throughout the research.
						</p>
						<p><b style="color:#0E249E;">Statistical Analysis</b>
										
						<p>
						At first, though the implication of statistical exercises on my actual research was difficult to be assessed, I learned more about organising data in presentable format through statistical exercises in<b style="color:#0E249E;"> Unit eight and Unit nine</b>. 
						</p>
						<p>
						Later, a review of concepts and application of statistics in better decision-making helps shed some light on how various data processing tasks related to research can best be analysed and presented to assist in investigations and research conclusions, as reflected in Figure 4 and Figure 5.

						</p>-->
						<p>
						Recognition of health technologies and their role in society is a vital discussion topic. 
						</p>
						<p>
						For this reason, in 2007, the 60th World Health Assembly embraced resolution WHA60.29, covering problems emerging from the improper deployment and use of health technologies and the need to establish emphasis in the selection and management of health technologies (The World Health Organization, 2007). 
						</p>
						<p>
						With the increased use of technologies in healthcare, it is crucial to ensure that technology-driven medical devices are available, accessible, affordable, appropriate, and used safely in society. 
						</p>
						<p>
						Given the criticality of the role, the technology-driven medical devices play in society, having regulated, tested and governed health technology should be coordinated by a designated health technology management in the national governments at all levels of health care.
						</p>
						<p>
						However, many developing countries and healthcare bodies have to rely mainly on equipment donations due to economic constraints. Although most of these donations are made with good intentions, the outcomes are not always positive if the donations are not properly tested and regulated and if it lacks adequate technical support, leading to many mismanagements in the technology acquisition process (The World Health Organization, 2007). Consequently, effective and efficient technical management of medical devices remains a concern in most low-income countries and middle-income countries as well as healthcare bodies due to bias from a legal and compliance standpoint despite the existence of dedicated, responsible units at the national level.
						</p>
						<p>
						Thus, this raises the critical question: Who should regulate technologies-driven health equipment? In Corazón's case study, Corazón's efforts to receive approval from multiple countries' medical device regulatory agencies should be vetted carefully, understanding whether these are unbiased approvals or based approvals led by the donations of implantable heart health monitoring devices. 
						</p>
						<p>
						Therefore, simply assuming that Corazón embodies the BCS's goal of carrying out professional responsibilities with due care and diligence under the relevant authority's requirements may not be accurate without in-depth insight into the context.
						</p>
						<p>
						However, as Kieron also emphasises in the peer posting, the introduction of a "Bug Bounty" scheme demonstrate Corazón's effort to maintain a secure application and the willingness to respect and value alternative viewpoints by accepting honest work criticism. 
						</p>
						<p>
						Nevertheless, in 2016 independent security research group MedSec attempted to attack several St. Jude Medical devices, released partial information about the vulnerabilities to the public, and made significant profits from the venture by working with Muddy Waters. On the other hand, MedSec's concerns regarding St Jude Medical's foot-dragging were not entirely misplaced as there has been virtually no improvement unless there is a major financial or reputational impact in doing so for technologies-driven health equipment technology manufacturers (Macnish & Ham, 2020). 
						</p>
						<p>
						Thus, MedSec/Muddy Waters/St Jude Medical case has two-fold should cybersecurity researchers be safeguarded from legal action such as the effort to sue MedSec by St Jude? How could we ensure that technologies-driven health equipment takes a severe step towards taking actions to test the flaws highlighted by independent researchers rather than foot-dragging with no improvement unless there is a significant financial or reputational impact in doing so? 
						</p>
						<p>
						Here MedSec/Muddy Waters/St Jude Medical case raises another critical question: Would be introducing a "Bug Bounty" be enough to evaluate Corazón's effort to align with BCS's professional competence and integrity? Would it be worthwhile to evaluate the processes undertaken by Corazón to evaluate vulnerability flaws highlighted through the "Bug Bounty" scheme before evaluating its Ethics and Professional Conduct?

						<p>
						I must stress that this is generic feedback and I am not discussing any one student in particular in this feedback, it is broad points that I have picked up as an over view when I looked at posts as a whole, holistcally. This feedback should also help you now as well as you move towards your first summative for your literature review.
						</p>
						 <p><b style="color:#0E249E;">Main Points:</b></p>
						 <ul style="list-style-position: none;">
						<p>
						</p>
						
							<li>Cite regularly - Any intext citation needs to be fully listed in the reference list at the end of your written piece as well, using the University of Essex Harvard Referencing system.</li>
						<p>
						</p>
							<li>Only add references in your list of references, that have been used in intext citation, [one has to mirror the other]</li>
						<p>
						</p>
							<li>When discussing subjective opinion, make it as objective as possible and when expressing subjective opinion also underpin your comments with something factual, [from research] so that the content does not feel as though these are thoughts that are plucked out of thin air.</li>
						<p>
						</p>
							<li>Write in a fully academic manner, and so formal, concise syntax [sentence structure]</li>
						<p>
						</p>
							<li>Use full words and not contractions and so for example, 'don't' should be does not. </li>
						<p>
						</p>
							<li> Keep paragraphs evenly weighted, and so don't have long paragraphs and then short paragraphs. </li>
						<p>
						</p>
							<li>When entering into discussion look at the pros and cons of the situtaion and debate and discuss your findings. This will mean you are evaluating your research, analysing your findings and then by looking at the pros and cons of discussion, you will be building your critical writing skills by debating content. </li>
						<p>
						</p>
							<li>Remember the academic 'default' font is Arial size 12. </li>
						<p>
						</p>
							<li>Double line space your content and have distinct spacing between your paragraphs. </li>
						<p>
						</p>
							<li>When using tables or diagrams; it is fine to use sections of tables to underpin a specfic point for example, but it is important to remember that tables are not a subtitute for textually interpreting research. So you can use tables to support a discussion, but a table should not be used instead of a discussion adn writing content. This is really important to remember for your summative. You are expected to dissect imformation and relate the content through structured written debate and discussion. </li>
						<p>
						</p>
							<li>Avoid using listing/bullet points in academic written work/essays. </li>

						The literature review formative is laid out to a very good standard. When using speech marks this denotes a quote has taken place, and so only use speech marks in academic writing if it is a quote and cite immediately after the quote. In the final summative don’t use hyphens to break up sentences use punctuation such as commas and full stops.
						</p>
						<p>
						Generally, though an excellent observation of academic conventions, regarding font, size and use of citation with a supporting reference list. The content is well laid out and is clear to see what direction you are taking for your subject matter and what the intentions are for the final summative.
						</p>
						<p>
						Syntax/sentence structure is concise and strong and your academic writing style is logical. For your final summative apply your current application to study shown in this formative to the whole summative and ensure that there is strong discussion and debate from lots of different research resources in the final summative.

						<p>
						In 2018, Cambridge Analytica was in the news in the United Kingdom and the USA (Confessore, 2018) for obtaining and sharing data obtained from millions of Facebook users. They obtained the data through innocuous surveys on Facebook (you may have seen this type of survey and probably participated at times). This is probably the highest profile of surveys used for alternative means and, probably, monetary gains. However, this happens often through various media.
						</p>
						<p>
						Consider how exactly this happened and why it was used. Find one or two further examples of inappropriate use of surveys and highlight the impact of all these examples from the various ethical, social, legal and professional standpoints that apply.

						Thank you for sending me your Unit 5 formative piece.

						</p>
						<p>
						This is both well written and interesting.
						</p>
						<p>
						There are some very imformative, interesting and well thought through dicussion points.
						</p>
						<p>
						The content demonstrates well how emotion over fact is arguably being used to shape the populous opinion but without the populous being fully aware or aware at all regarding what is going when it comes to shaping politics for example on a macro level, [with regard to the use of data without the poplus being aware of how theirs and friends data is being harvested].
						</p>
						<p>
						The discussion is extremely reflective regarding the shift in the use of social media as a tool that connects people as apposed to a tool that may arguably have other agendas currently, which for example may reflect attempting to change and shape our macro environments by stealth. We also saw this in the manner in which the main CEO of Facebook was politically challenged and arguably the change of Facebooks name to 'Meta' recently. Arguably again then a rebranding resulting from negative press.

						<p><b style="color:#0E249E;"><h3>Discussion Topic: Case Study, Accuracy of information </h3></b></p>
						
						<p>
						Abi is a researcher at an institute and also a statistical programmer. Abi has received a project from a manufacturer to review the nutritional value of a new cereal, Whizzz. Having collected the necessary data, he now needs to perform the appropriate analyses and print the reports for him to send to the manufacturer. Unfortunately, the data Abi has collected seems to refute the claim that Whizzz is nutritious, and, in fact, they may indicate that Whizzz is harmful.	
						</p>
						<p>
						Abi also realises that some other correlations could be performed that would cast Whizzz in a more favourable light. “After all,” he thinks, “I can use statistics to support either side of any issue.”	
						</p>
						<p>
						<b style="color:black;">Ethical Concerns:  </b> 
						</p>
						<ul style="list-style-position: none;">
						<p>
						</p>
						
							<li>Clearly, if Abi changed data values in this study he would be acting unethically. But is it any more ethical for him to suggest analysing correct data in a way that supports two or more different conclusions? </li>
						<p>
						</p>
							<li>Is Abi obligated to present both the positive and the negative analyses? </li>
							<p>
						</p>
							<li>Is Abi responsible for the use to which others put his program results? </li>
							<p>
						</p>
							<li>If Abi does put forward both sets of results to the manufacturer, he suspects that they will publicise only the positive ones. What other courses of action has he? </li>
						<p>
						</p>
						</ul>
						<p>
						You should also highlight legal, social and professional impacts of any choices made. Please note that there are no right or wrong answers here and you may introduce local, as well as international, legislature in your responses.

						<!-- <p><h3><strong>Summary Post:</h3></strong> </p> -->	
						<p><b style="color:#0E249E;"><h3>Summary Post:</h3></b></p>
						<p>
						The case study discussion raised ethical concerns over Abi’s approach and accountabilities as a statistical researcher when analysing the nutritional value of a new cereal Whizzz. From the case study, it is evident that Abi as a statistical researcher, can tamper with data in reporting the nutritional value of Whizz.	
						</p>

						<p>
						According to Frey (2018), the highest obligation for avoiding the use of deceitful or false data lies with each researcher, who should be able to provide comprehensive details regarding the data gathering process and analysis, allowing other researchers to examine and evaluate the rationality of the study and the interpretation of the data analyses.	
						</p>
						<p>
						A medical researcher, Eric Poehlman’s case relates to research misconduct relates to falsified data on the link between obesity and ageing, exemplifies some of the personal, professional, and legal consequences of using misleading data, he was then sentenced to a jail term of 1 year and 1 day with a fine of $180,000 and was banned for life from participating in any federally funded research activities (Interlandi, 2006).	
						</p>
						<p>
						Further, professional institutions for statistical researchers, such as the American Statistical Association (2022) and UK Statistics Authority (2018), outline the criticality of maintaining data and methods integrity for mitigating known or suspected restrictions, flaws, or biases in the data or methods, while evaluating the professional conduct of statistical researchers.	
						</p>
						<p>
						Therefore, even Abi is not a member of a professional institution, from a social, legal and ethical perspective, he is obliged to analyse correct data in a way that supports two or more different conclusions; however, there is not enough literature to support where Abi as a researcher could be accountable if manufacturer, publicise only the favourable results.	
						</p>
						<p>
						As Marzio (2022) stated, implementing a legal framework to safeguard consumers from being misled by organisations for economic benefits is crucial, which would prevent the manufacturer from publicising only the favourable results. Considering the American Society for Nutrition (N.D.), the European Council No 1924/2006 and the Norwegian Consumer Authority (2012), it is a fact that countries act individually and collectively to safeguard consumers by evaluating and dealing with apparent conflicts of interest in complex, twisted relations between nutrition research and marketing.

						<p>
						Thank you so much for your posts!
						</p>
						<p>
						There are some very imformative, interesting and well thought through dicussion points.
						</p>
						<p>
						Please see below my feedback to you all as a summary over view regarding my observations from your posts, as follows:
						</p>
						<p>
						Some good discussions which include criticality and evaluation. 
						</p>
						<p>
						Good to see the use of citation and list of references being used in formative, [for mosts posts] as well as summative. Do get in the habit of citation and reference lists even for formative activity.
						</p>
						<p>
						Some good research has taken place to respond to peers, this approach will also help develop knowledge for summative.
						</p>
						<p>
						There is effective concise debate taking place in the posts.
						</p>
						<p>
						Formatives are written in a formal academic context which is appropriately academically, and it is good to see that this is now automatically taking place in formative as well as summative.
						</p>
						<p>
						Good reflections regarding how decisions would impact stakeholders.
						</p>
						<p>
						Also, effective reflections and observations regarding how the scenario will affect the hypothetical person ‘Abi’ at the centre of this situation.
						</p>
						<p>
						Good reflections regarding ethics and potential impacts regarding this situation, both from an 'abiding by the book' situation and from a moral perspective.
						</p>
						<p>
						Some good suggestions regarding how Abi could overcome these problems posed.
						</p>
						<p>
						Effective dynamic discussion, occurring via concise and focused posts.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						Good reflections regarding effective due diligence and research occurring first before engaging in an activity relating to the scenario.
						</p>
						<p>
						Legal issues around the scenario have been effectively reflected upon.
						</p>
						<p>
						Some excellent peer reflections, reviews and responses.
						</p>
						<p>
						Accurate quotation of legislation which is integral to a situation like this
						</p>
						<p>
						Posts are informative, interesting and factual.
						</p>
						<p>
						An effective reflection regarding dishonesty and misconduct leading to a professor having to resign, as another example of the impacts of over looking or ignoring legalities.
						</p>
						<p>
						Good recaps regarding what we have studied so far.
						</p>
						<p>
						Effective reflections regarding bias.
						</p>
						<p>
						Many thanks with best wishes.

						Thank you for submitting your formative Lewle
						</p>
						<p>
						Your chosen layout for the statistical worksheets is completed to a very professional standard. The tab click through on the Excel sheet works particularly well and is an effective method of keeping all of the formative work in one accessible place. It is very clear to the viewer what they are looking at where.
						</p>
						<p>
						You have added annotation to break down what the ‘stats’ question is, and then reflected the numerical outcomes, also reflecting these in bar charts.

						</p>
						<p><b style="color:black;">Knowledge and understanding </b></p>
						<p>
						A very good concise and informative introduction to the Literature Review, identifying the audience for your assignment. Research approaches are mentioned, but these need to be more explicit. Under the header ‘Security considerations’ you have introduced several questions in this section. When completing an academic assignment, just focus on the assignment question that you are answering and don’t introduce more questions to the context. There is very good knowledge of the topic demonstrated in the assignment.
						</p>
						<p><b style="color:black;">Criticality  </b></p>
						<p>
						There is a developing sense of criticality in your content. Your writing style is strong, and there is clear interpretation of research, but there could be more comparison, discussion and debate of facts to look at both sides of a situation/the research. This is something to bear in mind for future academic assignments. You do link data and research based theory into the discussion and this is good practice.
						</p>
						<p><b style="color:black;">Use of relevant sources </b></p>
						<p>
						There is excellent use of relevant resources. Your discussion is focused and has a clear and well planned research thread all the way through the summative. Effective use of research resources from current publications.
						</p>
						<p><b style="color:black;">Structure and Presentation</b></p>
						<p>
						The structure and presentation of the Literature Review are completed to a very good standard. There is a good mix of visuals to support your text. Just a quick note, that as standard page numbers should be applied to an assignment. It is then good practice to add a contents page with sub-headers and corresponding page numbers at the beginning of the assignment.
						</p>
						<p><b style="color:black;">Academic integrity </b></p>
						<p>
						The assignment is within word count. This is good practice. You have a very solid, concise and focused academic writing style, and so continue with this approach moving forward. Citation is applied to content and underpinned by a full reference list. Moving forward I would just proof read your content one more time to pick up any minor typos/errors in your content. Tunrnitin is picking up a few sentence sections that are quite close to original sources. This is not a major cause for concern, but I just want to flag, to take care to fully paraphrase your assignment content well away from its original source.
						</p>
						<p><b style="color:#0E249E;">Points for development:  </b></p>
						<ul style="list-style-position: none;">
						<p>
						</p>
						
							<li>Reflect on comments in criticality and use more discussion and debate in your future academic assignments </li>
							<li>It is good practice to add pages numbers and a contents page to assignments of this nature </li>
							<li>Be more explicit in your intended methodologies of research resources at the beginning of a Literature Review moving forward </li>
							<li> Be mindful of ‘Turnitin’ matches</li>

						</p>
						<p>
						</p>
						 <p><b style="color:black;">Knowledge and understanding of the topic </b></p>
						 <p>
						 Excellent knowledge and understanding of your topic. You clearly understand the topic that you have chosen and how you will apply this to your research proposal. It is clear that time and planning have been applied to your concept presented in the summative.
						 </p>
						 <p>
						 </p>
						 <p><b style="color:black;">Criticality </b></p>
						 <p>
						 Very good demonstration of professionally based knowledge with some clear links to theory. The content whilst interesting and factual is a little descriptive. Drawing through deeper research from your research resources will give you that opportunity to develop debate and discussion in the context as well as reflecting a narrative of the topic itself. Also on the point of your research questions, this is more thinking forward, in these modules all studies do reflect ‘small scale’ research and for that your research question/s need to be very focused. And so if you have more than one research question applied in any given summative, ensure that the focus is very tight and the research questions themselves do not span discussion that may too broad.
						 </p>
						 <p><b style="color:black;">Use of relevant sources </b></p>
						 <p>
						 Very good use of relevant resources and it is clear that research has been applied to the topic. There is use of citation on your slides and a clear reference list. Moving forward I would be inclined to try to amalgamate a little more theory into your discussion to give the context that deep research which would further underpin your clear knowledge of the subject.
						 </p>
						 
						 <p><b style="color:black;">Structure and presentation </b></p>
						 <p>
						 The structure of the presentation is outstanding. The slides themselves are well thought through and whilst informative they are also visually stimulating. The content is logical and it is easy for the viewer to follow the narrative along with your audio presentation.
						 </p>
						 <p><b style="color:black;"> Presentation and Communication Skills </b></p>
						 <p>
						 The oral presentation is completed to a very good standard. The context of your discussion is clear and is very well supported by your power point. Its clear that the content has been rehearsed and you were more or less within the recommended timeline regarding your delivery of the presentation, which is good professional practice.
						 </p>
						 <p><b style="color:#0E249E;">Points for development:  </b></p>
						<ul style="list-style-position: none;">
						<p>
						</p>
						
							<li>Apply more theory to underpin your knowledge  </li>
							<li>Deeper research will allow you to develop your critical tone, which in turn will make your summative less descriptive  </li>
							<li>When applying research question/s to the summative keep them very focused as you are completing small scale studies which means there are limitations to the breadth of content you can discuss. Keeping the questions focused allows that deep research to take place, which in turn allows development of criticality </li>
