						<b>Discussion Topic:</b> Identify and discuss two security technologies and the context in which they can be employed. Your discussion could consider either network or/and software security issues. For example, if a network issue, what type of firewall would be ideal for the solution? What are the strengths and weaknesses of the solution?<br /><br />

						<h3>Assignment Topic:</h3>	 
						</p>
						<p>
						Queens medical centre is a community clinic and serves as the first point of call for any resident within the catchment area who happens to be unwell. The clinic has specialists in various areas of medicine. However, an appointment is required to schedule a consultation meeting with a specialist, which is done through a telephone call to the receptionist. The clinic has been experiencing a high volume of calls, causing a lot of problems for residents to get access to care on time. Also, the management of Queens medical centre needs to plan to be able to respond to the rate of growth of the community population.
						<br><br>

						To address this problem, the clinic management has decided to acquire a web-based appointment and scheduling management information system (ASMIS). This will allow appointments to be booked online by prospective patients. The system will collect vital information from the patient to be able to determine which specialist is best to attend to a given case, considering the availability and workload of the specialist doctor. The management of the clinic is concerned about the recent high rate of cybercrime and the government's policy on patient data protection. The IT team at the clinic has been tasked to install a secured ASMIS. As the Cyber Security Officer on the team that manages the clinic's IT systems, you are to advise the team on the potential cyber threats and how these can be mitigated.
						<br><br>
						
						<b>Produce a report to management providing the following information:</b><i>Details of the benefits of the ASMIS as well as the potential problems including potential cyber threats to the system. The report must include at least two UML diagrams. Each diagram should show aspects of the system and a threat modelling technique that can be used to identify and mitigate potential cyber threats. A background to the UML diagrams and modelling techniques, along with justifications for their use with supporting references. The Cyber Security technologies that can be used to address the problem, discussing the strengths and weaknesses of the solutions with references to examples in which the technology has been employed.

						Secondly, we used highlighted Python codes in the previous report as proposed solutions in our implementation using a MySQL database. <br /><br />

						<h3>Tutor Feedback Comments:</h3>	 
						</p>
						<p><b>Individual Essay</b></p>
						<p>
							The report is well written with providing detailed benefits as well as possible challenges associated with an online system. You demonstrate critical assessment of the proposed system and proposes a hybrid ASMIS solution that ensures all sections of society are covered. You identified the security requirements and employ UML diagrams such as use case and sequence diagrams  to provide a system overview showing the various actors and use cases of ASMIS,  and the interactions that can occur to achieve a given use case. You identified a number of threat modelling approaches and justify why you employed the STRIDE modelling technique to identify potential vulnerabilities. The components of the STRIDE technique are well explained, and the misuse case diagram is well developed.
						</P>
						<p>
						The table provided showing a summary of the STRIDE and the mitigation controls could have been expanded and explained. For example, I would have expected to see a discussion around the technologies mentioned in the table, the associated advantages and disadvantages. Also, your word-count was beyond the acceptable threshold.
						</p>
						<p>
						Overall, excellent work done. To improve your grades further, do take note of the developmental areas highlighted above.

						<p>
						The code has an implementation of a solution to ensure user passwords are secured, account lockout policy of a maximum of 3 failed attempts and strong password.  The solution is implemented using Python and mySQL and Secure Hash Algorithm. The use of this technologies and policy applied to the password are well justified.
						</p>
						<p><b style="color:black;">Application of knowledge and understanding: 30%</b></p>
						<p>
						Even though documentation was clear to follow and the implementation  logic was sound, it was not clear how the ‘asmis’ database and the ‘usertable’ were created. The Python code had assumed the database already existed. Meanwhile the README file does not also indicate how these must be created and that the Python code is dependent on them. You could have had another def method to to check and create the database if it does not exist. A full implementation in Python with embedded mySQL would have been excellent, which you could have taken a full advantage of object-oriented programming to engineered and organise your code. Also, linking your rationale for the implementation to particular threat type would have been excellent. For example was it addressing spoofing?  
						</p>
						<p><b style="color:black;">Structure and Presentation (as detailed in the assessment guidance): 30%</b></p>
						<p>
						There is a very good documentation of functionality and lines of code. The README file is informative with information on tests and the desired output once test is successful. You demonstrated some degree of criticality in your analysis and presentation of the proposed solution.
						</p>
