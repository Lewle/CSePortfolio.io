						</p>
						<p><b style="color:#0E249E;">#1. Cyber Security is a Board-level Problem </b>
						<p>
							Over the last few years, continuously evolving technology has become one of the most significant challenges faced by cybersecurity, as clearly reflected in figure 1. As the same as technological innovation, methods used by cybercriminals has also evolved. Therefore, it is often difficult to know which methods are being used by cybercriminals in an attack. For organisations to safeguard themselves, it is vital to upgrade their security measures at a similar phase.  
						</p>
						<p><a href="https://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-hacks/" target=”_blank”><img src="images/Art/World_Data_Breaches.png" alt="" width="679" height="620" /></a></p> 
						<p><b>Figure 1 (Source: New York Times, Forbes, The Guardian, Tech Radar, BBC, PC Mag – McCandless & Evans, 2021)</b></p>
						
						<p>
						Organisations can use skilled, ethical hackers to effectively identify and upgrade areas in their systems that are particularly vulnerable to modern hacking techniques. As a more comprehensive scanning of vulnerabilities, <b style="color:#0E249E;"> penetration tests pave the way to build a roadmap of improvements</b> for any organisation, highlighting where its security needs to adjust to the desired level of risk. Penetration testing takes advantage of known and unknown vulnerabilities while exploiting the human aspects of cybersecurity (Korpela, 2016).
						</p>
						<p>
						Therefore, performing penetration tests are crucial for avoiding terrible news as a data breach while ensuring cybersecurity is not the blocker for organisational activities but preferably <b style="color:#0E249E;"> helping to get a realistic insight into the attack surface of a given application, system, or infrastructure</b>.
						</p>
						<p>
						Basically, it is <b style="color:#0E249E;">going back to the Basics of CIA Triad </b>(figure 2), answering “it is possible to compromise our IT infrastructure maliciously to attain entry to unauthorised sensitive data or take over our systems for malicious purposes?” as an organisation that is prepared to face the evolving digital environment and everything that comes with it — including the ever-present dangers (Akridge,2020).
						</p>
						<p><img src="images/Art/CIA_Triad.png" alt="" width="521" height="251" /></a></p>
						<p><b>Figure 2: CIA Triad (Source: OWASP Toronto – Chen, 2018) </b></p>
						
						<p>
						So, what does it mean in the technological field that is agile and evolving rapidly? In an era of digital transformation, cloud computing, and a sophisticated threat landscape, regulators and investors are putting organisations under pressure to rethink how organisational functions have organised to identify risks to their business and manage them within an agreed risk appetite and threat landscape.
						</p>
						<p>
						As a result, Boards of directors are responsible for taking a more active role to<b style="color:#0E249E;"> manage cyber risks as a principle business risk, which must be collectively owned and managed by the organisation</b>. As cyberattacks could impact an organisation's finance, customers, business model and brand name, engaging cybersecurity more closely during business planning is crucial as integrated risk governance.  
						</p>
						<p>
						Then UK Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said, ‘<b style="color:#0E249E;">cybersecurity is not an IT issue, it is a boardroom issue</b>. Companies must be diligent and vigilant. They must do this not only because it is their duty under law, but because they have a duty to their customers’ - as her concise appraisal of business responsibility when it comes to cybersecurity (Financier Worldwide, 2017).
						</p>
						<p>
						The explosion of connectivity across the globe opens new ways for organisations for customer growth and products expansion. However, such opportunities come with<b style="color:#0E249E;"> recommending regulations and international standards as evolving customer data and intellectual property become new targets for information theft</b>, directly impacting enterprise performances and shareholder value. For example, UK NIS Regulations 2018 12(2)(c) outlines ‘process for regular testing of the effectiveness of security measures, such as by way of vulnerability scanning and penetration testing and then acting upon the results of such testing’ as obligations for relevant digital service providers (RDSPs) (Information Commissioner’s Office, 2021b).
						</p>
						<p>
						However, <b style="color:#0E249E;">  navigating the world of conflicting rules, cross-jurisdictional issues, and different compliance is not a simple task</b> and is a matter of significant revenue to companies when it comes to penalties. For example, though NIS concerns digital data, it is also possible that the same incident may also be a personal data breach (as per the UK GDPR). In such circumstances, it is important to notify both NIS competent authority and ICO (Information Commissioner’s Office, 2021a).  Another classic example would be the application of GDPR to Financial services firms. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) highlights GDPR compliance as a board-level responsibility, where it is crucial to have evidence demonstrating the steps that Financial services firms have taken to comply while treating customers fairly central to both GDPR and the FCA’s rules (FCA, 2018).   
						</p>
						<p>
						Considerably, <b style="color:#0E249E;"> information classification</b> involving taking an inventory of information assets that organisation stores and processes and identifying the sensitivity of that information for categorisation<b style="color:#0E249E;">  are a critical part of information security compliance programme</b> (Brodin, 2019).
						</p>
						<p>
						<b style="color:#0E249E;"> Going back to my experiences (in my previous workplace)</b>, as the Infrastructure team lead, I failed to see the importance of comprehensive scanning of vulnerabilities when the ERP project moved to the Cloud initially in 2017 connecting four global locations.
						</p>
						<p>
						Simultaneously, transitioning or implementing workloads into the Cloud without a strong strategy to manage cyber risks or non-compliance with regulatory requirements has never occurred to us as vulnerabilities that could negatively impact the organisation. Surprisingly this was not even highlighted in our annual IT Audit, so the topic of cybersecurity never reached the top-management level.   
						</p>
						<p>
						Through my current learnings, I understand that although, Cloud adoption means innovation, agility, speed of execution, the context of security has changed. In the Cloud, not all security and compliance controls are inherited or automatic, and lack of clarity in accountability across the value chain makes the Cloud security everyone’s responsibility, as stated in figure3. 
						</p>
						<p><a href="images/Art/Cloud_security.png" target=”_blank”><img src="images/Art/Cloud_security.png" alt="" width="727" height="338" /></a></p> 
						<p><b>Figure 3: Cloud security is everyone’s responsibility (Source: Deloitte, 2021)</b></p>
						<p>
						Therefore, relevant education and clear clarity in everyone’s responsibility are founding stones for robust IT and risk management.
						</p>
						<p>
						<b style="color:black;">So, what I now realised as key cybersecurity measures:</b>
						</p>
											
						<p>
							<li>It is important to prepare for the worse and act now.</li>
						</p>
						<p><img src="images/Art/DustWithFan.png" alt="" width="255" height="151" /></a></p>
						<p><b>(Source: OWASP Toronto – Chen, 2018) </b></p>
						
						
						<p>
							
							<li>Security is everyone’s responsibility. Thus, collaborating more closely with stakeholders outside of security to better understand the business context is vital in promoting security as a collective organisational effort.</li>

							<li>Penetration tests pave the way to build a roadmap of improvements, while patch management is of paramount importance.</li>

							<li>Having an updated data inventory is vital for data classification, and it is also paramount for navigating the world of conflicting rules and managing compliances.</li>
							<li>Having more competent security professionals through training and education can facilitate better security and awareness, leading to fewer breach opportunities.</li>
							<li>Building Secure Foundations at every stage <b>from </b></li>

						<b style="color:black;">Understanding the development as a team</b>
						<p>
						As each step of team development has its own recognizable feelings and behaviours; recognizing a team’s behavioural patterns through Bruce W.Tuckman’s work in the mid-1960s (framework of Forming, Storming, Norming and Performing behavioural patterns) helps to understand why things occurred in specific ways and provide a valuable basis for future team conversations.

							<b style="color:#0E249E;">Seminar Task: </b> 
						</p>
						<p>
							By utilising the blog post by Geer, D. (2015) on 8 Penetration Testing Tools That Will Do the Job, as a team activity, evaluate the tools discussed in Geer’s blog against the criteria: how easy was it to install, the flexibility of use, licensing, privacy and reputation of the tool itself to decide what tools we would prefer to use as the better choice with explanations.	 
						</p>
						<p>
							<b style="color:#0E249E;">Group Deliverable: </b> 
						</p>
						<P>
						In the penetration testing tools evaluation, in order to provide a clear assessment of each tool and provide a rationale justification, firstly, we have decided a descriptive basis on how to test each criterion for scoring:
						</p>	
						<p>
						<ul>
						<li><b>Ease of installation –</b> whether there is something already being installed in the tool, which require you as a user to run some commands or whether you actually have to change configurations in the system. </li>	
						<li><b>Ease of use –</b> whether the tool requires many supporting files while using the tool vs having available within the tool. For example - Metasploit scoring the lowest rating for needing to have many supporting files. </li>
						<li><b>Flexibility –</b> based on how many different types of parameters can be used for scanning. For example – Nmap scoring the highest rating for having many scanning parameters. </li>	
						<li><b>Licensing –</b> availability of the tool free of charge vs public source licensing vs licensing cost involvement. </li>
						<li><b>Privacy –</b> based on who is the developer, trustworthiness of the developer. Especially open source tools scoring the highest rate. For example, OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy) by well-known non-profit OWASP and Kali Linux scoring the highest rate. </li>
						<li><b>Reputation –</b> based on the number of users. </li>
						
						</ul>	
						</p>
						Then we have used a google sheet as a scoring table for each tool by going through each category.

						</p>
						<p>
						<ul>
						<li style="color:#0E249E;">The main obstacle of analysing penetration tools is when you are still a user of the tools at the academic level, and your team members already have field experience. Then, it is harder to provide an objective judgement about a tool for subjective opinion-based criteria such as the tool's reputation or ease of use. For example, considering the number of users as the criteria for reputation rating is purely based on selective team members' judgement on how far they have experienced active users of the tool in the field. </li>

						<h3>Development Team Project: Design Document </h3> 
						</p>
						<p>
							<b style="color:#0E249E;">Assignment Brief:  </b>

						 As a pentest team, we are asked to evaluate the e-health site provided by the peer development team to produce a design document detailing:
						</P>
						
						<p><ul>
							
							<li>Penetration testing methods</li>

							<li>Selection of penetration testing tool using STRIDE methodology as a threat-modelling approach </li>

							<li>Security challenges specific to E-Health</li>

						<h3>Development Team Project: Executive Summary </h3> 
						</p>
						<p>
							<b style="color:#0E249E;">Assignment Brief:  </b> 
						</p>
						<p>
						 Based on the submitted design document, produce an executive summary consisting of:
						</P>
						
						<p><ul>
							
							<li>List of security issues Found</li>

							<li>Details of applied methodologies (CIA, STRIDE as general foundation) and DREAD for risk assessment </li>

							<li>Assumptions and their impact on the outcome </li>
							
							<li>Sequence of applied tools  </li>
							
							<li>Interpretation of findings with recommendations  </li>

						<p	style="color:#0E249E;"> Though sections of the design document are split among individual team members on a preferential basis, the difference in everyone’s competencies/accountability have impacted each team members contribution.</p>
						
						
						<p style="color:#0E249E;"> <b>One specific area I would like to propose </b>in the next group activity is to not agree to the equal rating of individual peer view submission. In my opinion, we have experienced a loss of momentum and accountability of some of the team members for producing a quality report in the Executive Summary submission.  Despite a few backs and forth questions and requests, it was still visible the unwillingness of some team members in producing a clear, justified and well-referenced executive summary.</p>	
						
						</p></ul>
						
						<p	style="color:#0E249E;"><b>For example</b>, one team member had taken the entire section of the interpretation of results and ranking of identified securities issues with the proposed recommendation. However, the final report failed to provide a clear justification of the rankings and methodology used. It was evident that the particular team member intention was not to produce a clear interpretation of results or a transparent methodology for ranking but rather take a short route. Having waited until the last moment also let other team members accept the compromised report, compared to what was agreed before. It was already agreed to use DREAD for risk assessment when tasks/table of content were listed for Executive Summary) – I see this as a lack of accountability, especially in a situation when all agreed to share equal ratings in the submission. </p>
