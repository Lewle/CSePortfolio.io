									<p>Discuss why Cyber Security is now a global issue and why it is important for companies to invest in Cyber Security.</p>
									<p>The economic benefits to companies, the implications of a breach of regulations and laws such as reputational damage and trust and business competitiveness.</p>
									<p><b>Tutor feedback from discussion forum:</b></p>
									<p>Thank you for your participation in the first discussion forum of Launching into Cybersecurity Module.</p>

									<p> In this discussion forum you were invited to discuss why cybersecurity is now a global issue and why it is important for companies to invest in cybersecurity. The learning outcomes from this discussion were: a) to be to identify and explain the architecture, structure and functionality of basic components of a computer system, considering cybersecurity issues; b) Evaluate critically implications of the key vulnerabilities and threats of software and network security and approaches to mitigate these issues.
										
									<p>In total you made 5 posts including an initial post. These have been spread across the discussion over the three weeks period.</p>
										
									<p>You demonstrate clear appreciation of the importance of cybersecurity in your initial post, arguing for the need for business to go beyond traditional risk management to incorporating cyber threat assessment. Your analysis draws links between cybersecurity and politics, citing Denmark’s 2020 intelligence risk assessment report as an example which has been amplified due to the increasing rate of digital activities as a result of COVID-19.</p>
										
									<p>You demonstrated critical analysis and evaluation though your follow-on posts which considered links between causal factors and sources of these in various sectors, citing supply chains, insider threats and economic. Your contributions to other posts were thoughtful and well-researched, providing additional perspective to the discussion such as the need for information gathering and data management procedures to conform to regulations, citing the GDPR as example to ensure accountability and compliance.</p>
										
									<p>The summary post is well presented, collating all the issues discussed to present a coherent view of the of topic under discussion. Also, there is consideration of the literature citing good sources to support your point under discussion, demonstrating critical analysis and depth.
										
										I feel that you could have contributed more to the discussion, but you decided to stick with the minimum of 3 posts, which was the minimum requirement for the assignment. I am clear that you have a good understanding of cybersecurity issues and their implications. A range of reading has been consulted overall across your contributions which was good to see. Overall, a strong start to the module.
										
										To improve your grades further, do take note of the developmental areas highlighted above.</p>

								<p><b>Discussion Topic:</b></p>
								<p> Identify and discuss two security technologies and the context in which they can be employed. Your discussion could consider either network or/and software security issues.

								<p><b>Tutor feedback from discussion forum:</b></p>
								<p>Thank you for your participation in the second discussion forum of your Launching into Cyber Security Module.</p>

									<p>In this discussion forum you were invited to identify and discuss two security technologies and the context in which they can be employed. Your discussion could consider either network or/and software security issues. For example, if a network issue, what type of firewall would be ideal for the solution? What are the strengths and weaknesses of the solution?</p>
									
									<p>In total you made 6 posts including initial post.  These have been spread across the discussion over the three weeks period.</p> 
									
									<p>You demonstrate great understanding of network security by providing 2 emerging technologies that can be employed to address network security issues in your initial post. Your follow-on posts and contributions to other issues were excellent. You enriched the discussion with good contributions, particularly on the cloud-based WAF, UBA and Data Loss Prevention. You demonstrate similar critical analysis and evaluation in your contributions to other discussions. The summary post is well presented collating all the issues discussed to present a coherent view of the topic under discussion.</p> 
									
									<p>It was good to see you taking the feedback provided in discussion forum 1 on board,  by engaging a little more which reflected in the number of posts as well as quality of your post. This provided additional perspective to the discussion. However, You could have contributed more to the discussion which would have earned you some additional points.  Also, your initial post was excessive in terms of word limit, which I am sure you did acknowledge and adjusted in subsequent posts.</p>
									
									<p>Overall, you demonstrated great appreciation of network security and the technologies that can be deployed as part of a cyber security strategy. Overall, good work done.</p>
									
									<p>To improve your grades further, do take note of the developmental areas highlighted above.</p>
